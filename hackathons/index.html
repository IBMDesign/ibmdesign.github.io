					<p class="white">First things first</strong>, sign up for Bluemix! <u><a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#overview/overview.html#overview">What is Bluemix</a></u>, you ask? It's IBM's simple and flexible cloud development platform. Whether you're looking to build a web app or a mobile backend in the cloud, Bluemix has you covered with a variety of runtimes and services (APIs) that we're sure will fit your app's use case.</p>
					<p class="white">Since this is a relatively short event, a Bluemix 30-day free trial is well suited to anything you're looking to build for now - <strong>no up front credit card required either</strong>! Once everything is said and done (and you've won, right), you'll have an awesome app running on Bluemix and all the enterprise-grade tools at your disposal to take it to the next level.</p>

				<h2 class="teal">PLAY</h2>
				<p class="white">Log in and start playing! Head over to the catalog and <strong>spin up a boilerplate or a standalone runtime</strong> that works for you. Node.js, Ruby, and Java come standard, but you can bring your own (i.e. Python, PHP, etc...) from the Cloud Foundry community. Be sure to check out all of the different <strong>IBM, third party, and community services</strong> available in the catalog as well.</p>

				<p class="white">Once your boilerplate/runtime is up and running, follow its "<strong>getting started</strong>" guide to download:
				<ul>

					<li>the starter code that sits behind it</li>
					<li>the Cloud Foundry command line installer so that you can push your work back up to Bluemix</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Grid-cell pad-left">
				<h2 class="teal">PUSH</h2>
				<p class="white">Once you've installed the Cloud Foundry command line tool, <strong>open that starter code</strong> in the editor of your choice and <strong>make a change, any change</strong>. Let us guess, you added the text "Hello Hackathon" somewhere in the UI, didn't you?</p>
				<p class="white">Once your code is saved (and compiled if you're using Java), <strong>cf push</strong> back to Bluemix using the command line and realize the fruits of your labor, live in the cloud! For more info on pushing your code up to Bluemix, see the link below.</p>
				<p class="white"><strong>P.S.</strong> You don't always have to use the command line to push your code into Bluemix, this is just a good place to start. For more options, search the docs for our <strong>online editor</strong>, <strong>Bluemix Eclipse Plugin</strong>, or just Google <strong>any other Cloud Foundry compatible IDE plugins</strong>.</p>

			<h2 class="teal">IDEATE</h2>
			<p class="white">Now that you understand the basics, start thinking (if you haven't already) about <strong>what you actually want to build at this hackathon</strong>!</p>

			<p class="white"><strong>Ideation Activity:</strong></p>
			<p class="white">First ask yourself, <strong>who is the end user of my app</strong> and <strong>what problem(s) am I trying to solve for this persona</strong>? Really put yourself in your user's shoes and then write down <strong>as many ideas</strong> (even crazy ones) as you can that might solve one or more of their problems.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Grid-cell pad-right pad-left contentblock">
			<p class="white">We typically recommend <strong>sticky notes</strong> for this ideation exercise - especially if you're working with a team.</p>

			<p class="white">Silently throw <strong>one idea per sticky</strong> note up on a wall (time box this to only a few minutes), <strong>group them together</strong> based on commonalities, notice any <strong>trends</strong>, and then <strong>vote on what makes the most sense</strong>. You'll be amazed at how much focus this will bring to you and your team (if you're working on one - alone is cool too)!</p>

			<h2 class="teal">LEARN</h2>
			<p class="white">As you further define what you're actually going to build, <strong>look through the Bluemix catalog again</strong>. Determine which services make the most sense for your app. Once you're ready to <strong>experiment with or fully implement a service in your app</strong>, the Bluemix docs will help you further understand <strong>what a service does</strong>, <strong>how it works</strong>, and <strong>how your app can connect to it</strong>.</p>

			<div class="Grid-cell border-right pad-right pad-left">
			<h2 class="teal">GIT GOING</h2>
			<p class="white"><strong>Teaming up</strong>? Need somewhere simple and quick to manage all of your source code? We've got you covered.</p>

			<p class="white">Go to the overview pane for any Bluemix app you've created and click <strong>Add GIT</strong> up at the top by the app's url. This will place that initial starter code you edited a few steps back into an <strong>IBM GIT repo</strong>. It links directly to your app in Bluemix (and can auto-deploy to it when the origin is updated). Your source code is kept private by default.</p>

			<h2 class="teal">ASK QUESTIONS</h2>
			<p class="white">Check out our <strong>Dev 2 Dev forum</strong> any time you need a bit of extra help. If you ask a question in the forum, tag your post with <strong>#MixHack</strong> so we can track your questions and respond even faster!</p>
